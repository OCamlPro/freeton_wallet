drom account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get account info (local or from blockchain), or create/modify/delete accounts.



**DESCRIPTION**


This command can perform the following actions:

* 1.
  Display information on given accounts, either locally or from the blockchain

* 2.
  Create new accounts

* 3.
  Add information to existing accounts

* 4.
  Delete existing accounts


**DISPLAY LOCAL INFORMATION**


Examples:
::
  ft account --list
::
  ft account my-account --info


**DISPLAY BLOCKCHAIN INFORMATION**


Accounts must have an address on the blockchain.

Examples:
::
  ft account my-account
::
  ft account


**CREATE NEW ACCOUNTS**


Examples:
::
  ft account --create account1 account2 account3
::
  ft account --create new-account --passphrase "some known passphrase"
::
  ft account --create new-account --contract SafeMultisigWallet
::
  ft account --create new-address --address 0:1234...

Only the last one will compute an address on the blockchain, since the contract must be known.


**COMPLETE EXISTING ACCOUNTS**


Examples:
::
  ft account old-account --contract SafeMultisigWallet


**DELETE EXISTING ACCOUNTS**


Examples:
::
  ft account --delete account1 account2

**USAGE**
::
  
  drom account ARGUMENTS [OPTIONS]

Where options are:


* :code:`ARGUMENTS`   Name of account

* :code:`--address ADDRESS`   Address for account

* :code:`--contract CONTRACT`   Contract for account

* :code:`--create`   Create new account

* :code:`--delete`   Delete old accounts

* :code:`--info`   Display account parameters

* :code:`--keyfile KEYFILE`   Key file for account

* :code:`--list`   List all accounts

* :code:`--live`   Open block explorer on address

* :code:`--multisig`   Contract should be multisig

* :code:`--passphrase PASSPHRASE`   BIP39 Passphrase for account

* :code:`--surf`   Contract should be TON Surf contract

* :code:`--wc WORKCHAIN`   The workchain (default is 0)

* :code:`--whois ADDRESS`   Returns corresponding key name


drom call
~~~~~~~~~~~

Call contracts



**DESCRIPTION**


Call a method of a deployed contract. Use --local or --run to run the contract locally (only for get methods). If the params are not specified, {} is used instead. The message is signed if the --sign SIGNER argument is provided, or if the secret key of the account is known.

Examples:
::
  $ ft call giver sendGrams
          '{ "dest":"%{account:address:user1}", "amount":"1000000000000"}'
::
  $ ft --switch mainnet call msig confirmUpdate
          '{  "updateId": "0x6092b3ee656aaa81" }' --sign mywallet

**USAGE**
::
  
  drom call ACCOUNT METH [JSON_PARAMS] [OPTIONS]

Where options are:


* :code:`ACCOUNT METH [JSON_PARAMS]`   arguments

* :code:`-o FILE` or :code:`--output FILE`   Save result to FILE (use - for stdout)

* :code:`--run` or :code:`--local`   Run locally

* :code:`--sign ACCOUNT`   Sign message with account

* :code:`--subst FILE`   Read FILE and substitute results in the content


drom client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Call tonos-cli, use -- to separate arguments. Use 'ft exec -- CMD ARGS' for other commands.



**DESCRIPTION**


This command calls the tonos-cli executable while performing substitutions on arguments, and using the node of the current network switch. It is useful for commands that 'ft' cannot perform directly (calling debots for example).

'ft' uses the executable stored in $HOME/.ft/bin/tonos-cli. To create this executable, use:
::
  $ ft init

or:
::
  $ ft init client

The available substitutions on the arguments can be listed using:
::
  $ ft output --list-subst

For example, to substitute the address of the account 'multisig-debot':
::
  $ ft client -- debot fetch %{account:address:multisig-debot}

Note that it is also possible to ask 'ft' to call 'tonos-cli' instead of performing calls through TON-SDK Rust binding for other commands, using the FT_USE_TONOS=1 env. variable.

**USAGE**
::
  
  drom client -- ARGUMENTS [OPTIONS]

Where options are:


* :code:`-- ARGUMENTS`   Arguments to tonos-cli

* :code:`--exec`   (deprecated, use 'ft exec -- COMMAND' instead)

* :code:`--stdout FILE`   Save command stdout to file


drom config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify configuration



**DESCRIPTION**


Change the global configuration or the network configuration.

**USAGE**
::
  
  drom config [OPTIONS]

Where options are:


* :code:`--deployer ACCOUNT`   Set deployer to account ACCOUNT. The deployer is the account used to credit the initial balance of an address before deploying a contract on it.


drom contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manage contracts



**DESCRIPTION**


This command can perform the following actions:

* 1.
  Build a Solidity contract and store it in the contract database

* 2.
  List known contracts in the contract database

* 3.
  Import a contract into the contract database

* 4.
  Deploy a known contract to the blockchain


**BUILD A CONTRACT**


Example:
::
  ft contract --build Foobar.sol

After this command, the contract will be known as 'Foobar' in the contract database


**LIST KNOWN CONTRACTS**


Example:
::
  ft contract --list

List all known contracts: embedded contracts are contracts that are natively known by 'ft', other contracts are stored in $HOME/.ft/contracts, and were either built or imported by 'ft'.


**IMPORT A CONTRACT**


Example:
::
  ft contract --import src/Foo.tvm

Import the given contract into the contract database. Two files are mandatory: the ABI file and the TVM file. They should be stored in the same directory. The ABI file must use either a '.abi' or '.abi.json' extension, whereas the TVM file must use either '.tvc' or '.tvm. If a source file (.sol, .cpp, .hpp) is also present, it is copied in the database.


**DEPLOY A CONTRACT**


Examples:
::
  ft contract --deploy Forbar

Create an account 'Foorbar', deploy a contract 'Foobar' to it.
::
  ft contract --deploy Forbar --create foo

Create an account 'foo', deploy a contract 'Foobar' to it.
::
  ft contract --deploy Forbar --replace foo

Delete account 'foo', recreate it and deploy a contract 'Foobar' to it.
::
  ft contract --deploy Forbar --create foo --sign admin

Create an empty account 'foo', deploy a contract 'Foobar' to it, using the keypair from 'admin'.
::
  ft contract --deploy Forbar --dst foo

Deploy a contract 'Foobar' an existing account 'foo' using its keypair.



With --create and --replace, 1 TON is transferred to the initial account using a 'deployer' multisig account. The deployer account can either be set switch wide (ft config --deployer 'account') or in the deploy command (using the --deployer 'account' argument)

**USAGE**
::

Where options are:


* :code:`--build FILENAME`   Build a contract and remember it

* :code:`--create ACCOUNT`   Create ACCOUNT by deploying contract (with --deploy)

* :code:`--deploy CONTRACT`   Deploy contract CONTRACT

* :code:`--deployer ACCOUNT`   Deployer is this account (pays creation fees)

* :code:`--force` or :code:`-f`   Override existing contracts

* :code:`--import CONTRACT`   Deploy contract CONTRACT

* :code:`--list`   List known contracts

List available substitutions:
::
  $ ft output --list-subst

Output address of account ACCOUNT:

drom switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Display or change current network



**DESCRIPTION**


Manage the different networks. Each switch includes a set of accounts and nodes. TONOS SE local networks can be created with this command (see the SANDBOXING section below).


**EXAMPLES**


Display current network and other existing networks:
::
  $ ft switch

Change current network to an existing network NETWORK:
::
  $ ft switch NETWORK

Create a new network with name NETWORK and url URL, and switch to that network:
::
  $ ft switch --create NETWORK --url URL

Removing a created network:
::
  $ ft switch --remove NETWORK


**SANDBOXING**


As a specific feature, ft can create networks based on TONOS SE to run on the local computer. Such networks are automatically created by naming the network 'sandboxN` where N is a number. The corresponding node will run on port 7080+N.

Example of session (create network, start node, give user1 1000 TONs):
::
  $ ft switch --create sandbox1
::
  $ ft node --start
::
  $ ft node --give user1:1000

When a local network is created, it is initialized with:

* 1.
  An account 'giver' corresponding to the Giver contract holding 5 billion TONS

* 2.
  A set of 10 accounts 'user0' to 'user9'. These accounts always have the same secret keys, so it is possible to define test scripts that will work on different instances of local networks.

The 10 accounts are not deployed, but it is possible to use 'ft node --give ACCOUNT' to automatically deploy the account.

**USAGE**
::
  
  drom switch NETWORK [OPTIONS]

Where options are:


* :code:`NETWORK`   Name of network switch

* :code:`--create`   Create switch for a new network

* :code:`--delete`   Remove switch of a network
