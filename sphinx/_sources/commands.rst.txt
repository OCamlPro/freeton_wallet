ft client
~~~~~~~~~~~

Call tonos-cli, use -- to separate arguments. Use 'ft exec -- CMD ARGS' for other commands.



**DESCRIPTION**


This command calls the tonos-cli executable while performing substitutions on arguments, and using the node of the current network switch. It is useful for commands that 'ft' cannot perform directly (calling debots for example).

'ft' uses the executable stored in $HOME/.ft/bin/tonos-cli. To create this executable, use:
::

  $ ft init


or:
::

  $ ft init --client


The available substitutions on the arguments can be listed using:
::

  $ ft output --list-subst


For example, to substitute the address of the account 'multisig-debot':
::

  $ ft client -- debot fetch %{account:address:multisig-debot}


Note that it is also possible to ask 'ft' to call 'tonos-cli' instead of performing calls through TON-SDK Rust binding for other commands, using the FT_USE_TONOS=1 env. variable.

**USAGE**
::
  
  ft client -- ARGUMENTS [OPTIONS]

Where options are:


* :code:`-- ARGUMENTS`   Arguments to tonos-cli

* :code:`--exec`   (deprecated, use 'ft exec -- COMMAND' instead)

* :code:`--stdout FILE`   Save command stdout to file

ft crawler
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Crawl all transactions to an address and fill a psql database



**DESCRIPTION**


This command will crawl the blockchain and fill a PostgresQL database with all events related to the contract given in argument. The created database has the same name as the account.

This command can run as a service, using the --start command to launch a manager program (that will not detach itself, however), --status to check the current status (running or not) and --stop to stop the process and its manager.

A simple session looks like:
::

  sh> ft crawler myapp --start &> daemon.log &
  sh> psql myapp
  SELECT * FROM freeton_events;
  serial|                              msg_id                              |      event_name       |           event_args                            |    time    | tr_lt
      1 | ec026489c0eb2071b606db0c7e05e5a76c91f4b02c2b66af851d56d5051be8bd | OrderStateChanged     | {"order_id":"31","state_count":"1","state":"1"} | 1620744626 | 96
  SELECT * FROM freeton_transactions;
  ^D
  sh> ft crawler myapp --stop
  



**ERRORS**


The crawler may fail connecting to the database. You can use PGHOST to set the hostname of the database, or the directory of unix sockets (default is /var/run/postgresql). You can use PGPORT for the port (default is 5432).

The crawler may also fail for authorizations (something like FATAL: 28000: role USER does not exist ). In such a case, you need to configure postgresql to allow your role (<user> is your username):
::

  
       sh> sudo -i -u postgres
       root> psql
       CREATE USER <user>;
       ALTER ROLE <user> CREATEDB;

ft switch create
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new switch for an existing network, or create a sandbox local network



**DESCRIPTION**


This command is used to create new switches, either for existing remote networks (mainnet, testnet, etc.) by providing their URL with --url, or to create new local networks running TONOS SE (such switches must be called 'sandboxNN' where NN is a number). Each switch includes its own set of accounts and nodes.

When a new switch is created, it immediately becomes the current switch.


**EXAMPLES**


Display current network and other existing networks:
::

  $ ft switch list


Change current network to an existing network NETWORK:
::

  $ ft switch to NETWORK


Create a new network with name NETWORK and url URL, and switch to that network:
::

  $ ft switch create NETWORK --url URL


Removing a created network:
::

  $ ft switch remove NETWORK



**SANDBOXING**


As a specific feature, ft can create networks based on TONOS SE to run on the local computer. Such networks are automatically created by naming the network 'sandboxN` where N is a number. The corresponding node will run on port 7080+N.

Example of session (create network, start node, give user1 1000 TONs):
::

  $ ft switch create sandbox1

::

  $ ft node start

::

  $ ft node give user1 --amount 1000


When a local network is created, it is initialized with:

* 1.
  An account 'giver' corresponding to the Giver contract holding 5 billion TONS

* 2.
  A set of 10 accounts 'user0' to 'user9'. These accounts always have the same secret keys, so it is possible to define test scripts that will work on different instances of local networks.

The 10 accounts are not deployed, but it is possible to use 'ft node give ACCOUNT' to automatically deploy the account.

**USAGE**
::
  
  ft switch create NETWORK [OPTIONS]

Where options are:


* :code:`NETWORK`   Name of network switch to create

* :code:`--image DOCKER`   Docker image to use for sandboxes
